# CocktaStudio2025_-_CocktaScript_v5

Hello everyone, this is my first final school project for programming. At first I created only the programming language KokktaScript, and then I wanted to create a code editor for it KokktaStudio 2025. In this project, the code for the form in Windows Forms and also synaxis and language logic will be posted in open access. You can freely modify my code and add and improve my language and code editor. The entire project was written in C# and the language runs on the C# interpreter.
